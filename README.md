# ImageRegistration
This repository is to retain substance for Medical Image Registration.

Since the ITK is notably complicated and require the knowledge of C++ templated programming, there are a lot of efforts to do. The main aim of this period is to get the work done with any flexible means.

So I choose the SimpleElastix for simolifing the problems confronted.
